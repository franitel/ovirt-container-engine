The persist manifest uses nfs storage exported in 192.168.200.2 with the following attributes:

pgdata is exported via persist volume claim - load the volume claim manifests to cluster and define the following export:
/exports/pgdata  *(rw,anonuid=999,anongid=999,all_squash,sync,no_subtree_check)
chown the folder to be owned by uid and gid 999 (that's the uid and gui of postgres process running in postgres pod - they must fit)

certs plugins and backup dir are owned by root and needs to be exported with the following:
/exports/certs  *(rw,anonuid=0,anongid=0,all_squash,sync,no_subtree_check)
/exports/plugins  *(rw,anonuid=0,anongid=0,all_squash,sync,no_subtree_check)
/exports/backup  *(rw,anonuid=0,anongid=0,all_squash,sync,no_subtree_check)
